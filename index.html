            Definition - What does Yoga mean? Yoga is a physical, mental and
            spiritual practice that originated in ancient India. First codified
            by the sage Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras around 400 C.E, the
            practice was in fact handed down from teacher to student long before
            this text arose. Traditionally, this was a one-to-one transmission,
            but since yoga became popular in the West in the 20th century, group
            classes have become the norm. The word yoga is derived from the
            Sanskrit root yuj, meaning “to yoke,” or “to unite”. The practice
            aims to create union between body, mind and spirit, as well as
            between the individual self and universal consciousness. Such a
            union tends to neutralize ego-driven thoughts and behaviours,
            creating a sense of spiritual awakening. Yoga has been practiced for
            thousands of years, and whilst many different interpretations and
            styles have been developed, most tend to agree that the ultimate
            goal of yoga is to achieve liberation from suffering. Although each
            school or tradition of yoga has its own emphasis and practices, most
            focus on bringing together body, mind and breath as a means of
            altering energy or shifting consciousness.
